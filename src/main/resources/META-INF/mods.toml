     Hello Lads,
     In this mod, we imported ores/minerals like Morkite or Nitra from the awesome game "Deep Rock Galactic" into Minecraft.

     The highlight of this mod is that you can brew beers in a brewery (Lloyd) which have special effects just like in DRG. The recipes are the same as in drg exept a few Drinks. These Recipes are displayed in the Images-Tab Also, Lootbugs will now spawn within the world.

     The ores (Nitra, Morkite, Red sugar), hops for brewing also generate in the world, just like Ommoran Heartstones and Pubs(These was a Structure generation test but i've forget to disable the generation in the 1.18 build :D).

     Lastly, we have our four supported Languages:
     LOLCAT
     English (US)
     English (upside down)
     last and very much least, German


     with regards,

     TheTrueSCP and MonsieurHannes

     Rock and Stone, Lads!
